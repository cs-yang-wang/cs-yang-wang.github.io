I currently have enough MSc students in my group, so I am not actively recruiting MSc students for Fall 2022. If you are looking for funded MSc positions, you should also check out other professors in the department (e.g. Prof.<a href="https://yi-ming-qian.github.io">Yiming Qian</a> who also works in computer vision), since I am unlikely to have such positions except for very rare cases (e.g. if you are likely to get NSERC scholarship, or you have a scholarship from home country that cover your expense of graduate studies, or you already have good publications and your profile is truly exceptional).<br><br>
Also note that I am not planning to recruit undergraduate students for research in the foreseeable future. If you are looking for undergraduate research opportunities, I encourage you to talk with other professors in the department.<br><br>

I may still have opennings for excellent PhD applicants. <br><br>

If you are interested in joining my group, please send me the following items via email (PDF or plain text, or URL to a website containing these items).

<ul>
  <li>A copy of your CV.
  <li>Transcripts (unofficial ones are sufficient) from ALL post-secondary institutions attended -- if you have a Master's degree or currently in a Master's program, you should send me transcripts from both your Bachelor's and Master's programs. Also note that you should send me the transcripts (I need the information on what courses you have taken), not just GPA.
  <li>Up to three representative publications written in English if you have (I am unlikely to consider PhD applicants without prior publications)
  <li>TOEFL/IELTS score when applicable (our department does not require GRE), or mention that you will take the test in the near future.
  <li>A brief description of your research interests, and your background in computer vision, machine learning, or related areas in AI and data science. This can be courses, projects, online courses/certificates (e.g. Coursera, Udacity).
  <li>Other information that you think might be relevant. For example, if you have a scholarship from your home country that can fund your grad studies in Canada, you can mention it.
</ul>

<u><em>Please put "GradApp" somewhere in the subject of your email</em>, e.g. <em>Subject: graduate research position in Computer Vision? (GradApp)</em>. This tells me that you have read this page.</u> If you have followed these instructions and your email contains all the information requested above, rest assured that I will read your email. However, due to the large number of requests, I cannot respond to all of them. If I am interested in your application, I will reply within a week and start the conversation (and request more information from you if necessary). <u><em>If you do not hear from me for more than one week, it means that I do not have a position for you -- in this case, please do not send me repeated emails, unless your profile has significantly improved, e.g. you get a new publication in a good venue. </em></u><br><br>
